Eye Tracking on iPhone (iOS)

> During my thesis, I investigated eye-tracking on iPhone X using the TrueDepth camera. I created an app that can be used completely without hands. With the help of the eyes and an input command (here a "DUCK"-Mouth, because it interfered least with the other facial features and therefore directly related to the accuracy of the point) you can navigate through an app.
